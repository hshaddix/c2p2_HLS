# Hello!! 

This is a repository for HLS related code pertaining to the Spring 2025 c2-the-p2 advanced seminar

## Main Exercise:

First we will want to navigate to an environment in which we can utilize HLS... 

Now that we have our environment setup with xilinx and Vitis HLS, we can start to compile some code!!

First, open the file designated as 'Improper_Code.cpp.' Take a look at this code, do not focus on the logic itself, but note the data types, the loops, and considerable lack of efficiency pragmas. Compile this using the Vitis GUI, by clicking the 'C Synthesis' button in the bottom left. 
  - Make note of the resource utilization.
  - Navigate to the 'warnings' tab on the bottom. What do you see?
  - Consider how this file may need some brushing up given the concepts you have seen regarding pipelining, parallelization, and throughput.
